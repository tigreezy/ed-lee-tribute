    <p class="text-center" style="font-family: Roboto Slab">"Ed was not a politican. He did not always deliver the best sound bite or carry the room with unspoken charisma. Flash never mattered to him. What mattered most to him always was helping his fellow San Franciscans. Opponents may have disagreed with him on policy, but everyone agrees, our mayor was a good man with a good heart."</p>
